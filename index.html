<h1>1) DECIDE WHERE TO GO</h1>
You need somewhere to fly to before you set off right?! Where in the world takes your fancy? The Greek Islands? The Swiss Alps? Or maybe somewhere a little more off the beaten track like the temples of Myanmar, or the mountains of Kyrgyzstan? For some ideas on places to go check out the links below.
<br><br>
2) CHECK IF YOU NEED A VISA
It’d be a disaster to fly to the far side of the world only to be refused entry by the border control! Checkout the official website of your destination country and see what the deal is. Basically there are four times of visa setup: visa free, visa on arrival, evisa, and your stock standard visa. Some visas are fast and painless while others can be painful and time consuming to obtain. If you are planning your trip in the next few weeks you need to get on top of the visa now as the process can takes weeks.
<br><br>
3) DECIDE THE LENGTH OF YOUR TRIP
Are you after a short weekend away, somewhere to spend your summer vacation, or are you going all in for a year? You need to have a rough idea how long your trip will last in order to know how much money you’ll need in the bank.
<br><br>
4) RESEARCH COSTS
So you know where you want to go and how long you want to stay, now it’s time to start having a research into how much this trip is gonna cost you! So you know how much your visa is going to cost you, now its time to have a look into how much your flight is going to cost you, but don’t book anything just yet! Once you have an idea of the cost of a flight, you can begin having a general look into the prices of accommodation, attractions, eating out, and transportation, working out roughly how much you’ll spend in a day. Be sure to account for how much you plan to drink! Be sure to always over estimate your expenses. It’s better to have too much money than too little!
<br><br>
5) SAVE MONEY
So you know the cost of you visa, roughly how much you’re going to spend per day, and the cost of a flight. Now it’s time to consult your bank account and maybe give that piggy bank a rattle. Maybe you already have enough stashed away, but maybe you’ve still got a way to go. For tips to save for your trip checkout the links below.

6) VISAS & IMMUNISATIONS
Ok, so you have enough in the bank and are ready to put the wheels in motion. If you haven’t already sorted the visa, do that now. Depending on where you’re going, you might need to get immunisations. Check online or with you’re GP to get the lowdown.

7) BOOK YOUR FLIGHT
Now we’re moving. Have a look online for flights comparing different sites. As a general rule, booking a return flight is cheaper than two one way flights. Be sure to check different dates as the prices can vary significantly. Likewise, be sure to try different connections as it can sometimes be a lot cheaper having a two or three flight connection than a direct one. The closer to your date the higher the prices will go, so it’s best to book your flight as early as possible.


8) BOOK ACCOMMODATION
You’re going to need somewhere to sleep. Choose between hostels, hotels, or whatever kind of accommodation takes your fancy. The sooner your book the more range you’ll have, the later you leave it the narrower your options. Be wary that cities can fill up on weekends and sometimes every hostel will be full and the cheapest hotel bed will be $200+. Make sure that doesn’t happen and book in advance, otherwise you might end up on the street! If you want to use Couchsurfing, now is the time to send out couch requests. CS also has a message board and groups for emergency requests. If you find yourself without a bed, there’s a chance someone might be able to host you at the very last minute. I always book a hostel for a night or two to see what the place is like, and then extend it for the rest of my stay. Hostels can have very different vibes.

9) PLAN ACTIVITIES
Have a research of your destination and write down the main activities and sights, how much they cost, and what your transportation options are. Have a look into city tourist cards which can you save you a lot if you plan to see a lot.

10) CONTACT YOUR BANK
Imagine you arrive at your destination, get a free ride to your accommodation, then track down a local restaurant for a fancy meal and a beer. All is great until you go to pay and your bank card bounces… Let your bank know you’re going overseas, else they might flag and block your card for fraudulent transactions. While on the subject of banks, most offer travel cards. You can load a number of currencies onto these cards (at your banks exchange rate), which could save you big conversion fees overseas. Often you recieve two cards which can be perfect for couples, else you can hide one in the bottom of your pack in case anything every happened to your primary card.


11) TRAVEL INSURANCE
Travel insurance covers you for medical expenses after sudden illness or injury, emergency dental, repatriation, cancellation expenses, trip interruption expenses, personal liability, and covers your baggage and personal items from theft, loss, or accidental damage.

12) PACK YOUR BAG
